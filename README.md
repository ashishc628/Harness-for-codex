# Harness for Codex

A minimal repository harness for Codex-based work.

The goal is to give every future task a predictable starting point:

- one place for agent instructions
- one bootstrap command
- one check command
- one test command
- one full evaluation command
- optional hooks and devcontainer metadata
- lightweight documentation for decisions and tasks

## Quick Start

```sh
scripts/bootstrap
scripts/check
scripts/doctor
```

## Workflow

1. Write the task brief in `tasks/` when the work needs context.
2. Implement changes in the relevant project files.
3. Record durable decisions in `docs/decisions.md`.
4. Run `scripts/check` before finishing.

## Automation Entrypoints

- `scripts/bootstrap`: install or prepare dependencies when a known stack is present.
- `scripts/check`: run formatting, linting, type checks, and tests when available.
- `scripts/test`: run the test suite when available.
- `scripts/eval`: run `doctor`, `bootstrap`, and `check` as a handoff gate.
- `scripts/doctor`: print repository and tooling readiness.
- `scripts/hooks`: install optional local hooks through `pre-commit`.

If you use `just`, the same commands are exposed in [`justfile`](justfile):

```sh
just check
just eval
```

These scripts are safe defaults for an empty or early-stage repository. Extend
them as the project grows.

## Harness Metadata

[`harness.yml`](harness.yml) records the canonical command names, expected
documentation files, and task-loop stages. Keep it aligned with `AGENTS.md` and
the scripts in this repository.

## Optional Environment

The repository includes a minimal [dev container](.devcontainer/devcontainer.json)
that runs `scripts/bootstrap` after creation. It is optional; local development
works without Docker.
